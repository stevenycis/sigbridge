## What is this?
This is a python (v2.7) application with minimal UI that replicates trade signals from TradeStation to one or more Interactivebroker clients.

## Dependencies
- ibpy2
- pyinstaller
- pyyaml
- quickfix

## Configuration
IB clients are configured in a yaml file under "conf" dir. 
The attributes in the config file should be self explainatory.  
TradeStation needs to have "Trade manager" configured to send open/filled order emails to the host computer's IP where this program resides.  It should be "localhost" in the smtp field if they are on the same computer.

## Run & Test
Run:  
python Sig_Bridge.py

Tests:  
- Sending simulated trade signal as if it's from TradeStation: python tests/SendSig.py 

## Build & Distribute
To create distributable app, run:  
pyinstaller Sigbridge.spec

The distributable folder will be under the resulting "dist" dir.  
I choose to not use "one file" executable distribution, because: 
- There's an issue with ibpy2 lib import when packaged into an extractable executable.
- One file executable is less secure and takes longer to start since it needs to extract all files to a temp dir at run time before executing the main program.

## Limitations
Currently works on Stocks with Market orders ONLY.
